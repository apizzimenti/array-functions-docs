### Array-Functions
Functions for JavaScript arrays that aren't shipped with the standard version of the language. Just take any array, and...
`array.funk.<function>`

That easy. Although these functions do extend the Array prototype, they are namespaced as to not create confusion.

This project is available through Bower and npm.
